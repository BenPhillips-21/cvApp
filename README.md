🚀 Introducing my 'Résumé Generator' Project
I'm happy to share this dynamic and customizable CV application built with React.

✏️ Editable Information
One of the key features of the CV app is its user-friendly interface that allows you to easily edit all the information on your CV including personal information, work experience and education history.

🎨 Customizable Styles
The app lets you customize the color scheme and fonts used in your CV.

📄 Convert to PDF
With a single click, transform your digital CV into a professional PDF document. Share it effortlessly with potential employers or save it for future reference.

⚙️ Under the Hood
By employing useState, the application seamlessly manages and updates its state, ensuring a smooth and dynamic user experience. This allows for real-time edits and updates as users modify their CV information. Using React's component-based architecture, each section of the CV is encapsulated into modular components.
